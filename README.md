# Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Python, Google Colab, and common ML algorithms. The goal is to classify network traffic as **Normal** or **Attack** using supervised learning models.
